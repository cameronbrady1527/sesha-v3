// You are an expert senior news editor writing an article that is a digest of longer source content.  Reprint the provided article line by line, but with a few small edits:

// - expertly paraphrase each line to avoid plagiarism (but keep source tags)
// - make sure the article flow smoothly from each topic (add transition phrases or move content around if absolutely necessary)
// - remove any blatant repetition

// The purpose is to clean up the writing and ensure that everything is fully paraphrased and credited in the source tags.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the article word for word, but with three small edits: 

1. In quote attribution, replace annoying and overly complex words like "stated" or "asserted" or "proclaimed" with simpler words like "said" or "wrote" depending on the context.
For example, you would rewrite the sentence: "In the interview, Nume stated: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1) " as "In the interview, Nume said: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1)"

2. Remove specific phrases like "in a signficant development" or "adding to the controversy" or "as the world watches" and replace with either nothing or a more simple, pithy transition.

Example input: 
Nume has previously argued that the polls don't support a Carlson win in the 2024 election. (Source 1) 
In a significant development, in an interview last month, he claimed Carlson is "a lock in." (Source 1) 

Example rewrite:
Nume has previously argued that the polls don't support a Carlson win in the 2024 election. (Source 1) 
But in an interview last month, he claimed Carlson is "a lock in." (Source 1) 

3. CRUCIAL: Remove the very last paragraph or sentence if it is "waflle", pure opinion or summary. For example:

Example input: 
{ imagine a whole article here and then...}...
As the Olympic season heats up, it will be thrilling to see if Richardson finally gets the win.

Example rewrite:
{ imagine a whole article here and then the last sentence was removed since it was just waffle/summary}

But don't remove it if it wasn't summary/waffle.

const USER_PROMPT = `INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the article word for word, but with three small edits: 

1. In quote attribution, replace annoying and overly complex words like "stated"/"stating or "asserted" or "asserting" or "proclaimed" with simpler words like "said" or "saying" or "wrote" depending on the context, and remove repetitious or overly clunky language.
For example, you would rewrite the sentence: "In the interview, Nume stated: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1)  " as "In the interview, Nume said: 'I love sushi.' (Source 1) "
As another example, you would rewrite a passage like "'It was a bit of a mess, to say the least,' Nume said. (Source 1) Nume also joked about the gravity of the situation saying, 'this is a heavier situation than Einstein could've predicted,' referring to the great scientific mind of the 20th century. (Source 1) " to a simpler, better version like this: "'It was a bit of a mess, to say the least,' Nume said. (Source 1)  'This is a heavier situation than Einstein could've predicted,' he added. (Source 1) " 
In that example, the quotes are tagged to a speaker but the quotes speak for themselves wihtout extranneous repetitious content.

2. Remove specific phrases like "in a signficant development" or "adding to the controversy" or "as the world watches" and replace with either nothing or a more simple, pithy transition.
