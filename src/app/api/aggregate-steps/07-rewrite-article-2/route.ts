INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the article word for word, but with one small edit: Add in-sentence source attribution once per source article used. Add the attribution the first time the source article is referenced. Leave the source article tags as is, since they are separate from IN-SENTENCE attribution.

NOTES:
- The first paragraph should NOT have attribution to a source article(s)
- Only add source article attribution after the article once per source article
- The only edits should be the source article attribution
- Make sure the correct names of the source articles are used with proper capitalization
- Don't add extra attribution to quotes or lines with source article attribution in them already
- Only credit one source article at a time
- Source article attribution should only appear at the end of sentences.
- Source article attribution could include "...reported X." or "...according to X." or "...X reported."
- Leave the source article tags in parentheses at the end of every sentence, for example: (Source 1 NewsCo)
- Don't add new credits for anything from editor notes
- Dont add new credits for anything that is marked with a source number but no credit, for example, (Source 1) should not be credited since it doesn't have a credit like "CNN" inside the tag
- Make sure to keep all existing instances of in-sentence attribution
{{#initialSources.0.useVerbatim}}This opening text should remain unaltered, since it was already manually written by the editor: 
{{stepOutputs.factsBitSplitting.0.text}}{{/initialSources.0.useVerbatim}}

NOTE: If there are multiple sources in the tags, use the first source listed in the tag. For example, if provided "Blah blah blah (Source 1 CNN, Source 3 NumeNews)" you would add credit as "Blah blah blah, according to CNN. (Source 1 CNN, Source 3 NumeNews)" since that is the first source listed in the source tag. But remember, if the source doesn't have a credit and only has a number it should not be credited.

Remember, you are only adding ONE attribution per source article used.

"It was hectic, but fun," Nume said in a news conference. (Source 1 People)

Nume later shared his hopes for the beatbox scene, hoping for more gender diversity. (Source 1 People) Nume is 28, and lives in Brooklyn. (Source 4 no credit) 

He's lived in Brooklyn for 5 years. (Source 4) He lives there with his partner. (Source 2 MSN)

Note that you added in-sentence attribution ONCE per source used. You don't add in-sentence attribution to the lede (the first paragraph). You keep the source tags after each sentence.
